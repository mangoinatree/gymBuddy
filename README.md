# Gym Buddy

A app that that motivates you and keeps track of your physical achievements in and out of the gym. Allows an optional image upload. Can as as many or as little tags to a post as you would like, and posts can be filtered by tag to look back at specific acheivements!

I made this enhance my Redux toolkit and React skills.
